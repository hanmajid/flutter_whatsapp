Whatsapp (ver. 2.19.98) clone using Flutter.

## About

I made this for my study/exercise on Flutter. I only make the client-side app, the server side is a dummy server.

## Development

To run this project on your own, do the following: 
1. Clone this project.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Create your own Firebase project and add the `google-services.json` to the folder `android/app` (for Android). This is a requirement for QR code reader package.
4. Run the project using `flutter run` or using your IDE's tools.
5. To run the test run the script 'run_ui_tests.bat' in the terminal.
